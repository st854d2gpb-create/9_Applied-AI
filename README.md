# Baumarkt-Buddy 🛠️
*Rule-checked shopping assistant for DIY stores – MBA Applied AI group project (vibe coding)*

## What is it?
Baumarkt-Buddy is a mobile web app for DIY-store customers. The customer describes
a home project – **by typing, by voice or with a project button** – answers at most
three short questions and gets a **checked shopping list**: materials, tools and
safety gear with quantity, price, stock and aisle/shelf in the chosen store.

**Safety comes before convenience: when in doubt, the app stops instead of guessing.**
Dangerous work (electrics, gas, load-bearing walls, hidden pipes and cables) is
refused with a referral to a professional.

**Release 1 (MVP)** offers 6 projects of the team's project catalogue
(`data/project_catalogue.xlsx`, draft v1) with sample data. The team starts with a
smaller project list (3 Nov 2026): the three "Doors & locks" projects are not offered
for now – their templates stay in `app/data/templates/` (listed under
`inactiveTemplates` in `app/config.js`) and are still tested.

| Group | Projects | Safety level |
|---|---|---|
| Wall mounting | Hang a shelf · Hang a wall cabinet · Anchor a shelf (anti-tip) | Mounting – full |
| Wall mounting | Hang a picture | Mounting – light |
| Decorating | Paint a wall · Hang nonwoven wallpaper | Basic |
| *Not offered for now:* Doors & locks | Install a glass door · Install a sliding door · Change the lock of an interior door | Mounting – full / Basic |

*Basic* projects ask no wall or load questions; the high-risk filter, catalogue
check, product warnings and stop rules always run. Photo entry, saved projects,
offline mode, store maps and step-by-step guides are planned for later releases
([R2–R4 requirements](requirements/requirements-R2-R4.md)).

👉 **Live app:** `https://st854d2gpb-create.github.io/9_Applied-AI/` (after GitHub Pages is enabled, see below)

## Why this idea?
Real customer problem, our own sample data, low GDPR risk, buildable in 2 weeks,
and a clear B2B customer (the DIY store).

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| Input | `app/app.js` | Free text, voice and project buttons. Typed and dictated text use the same path (`submitText`) – no special path for speech |
| Voice input | `app/speech.js` | Browser Web Speech API → editable transcript; never records, stores or sends audio itself |
| AI (understanding only) | `app/ai-adapter.js` | Classifies the intent and extracts candidate values as schema-validated JSON. **Never chooses products or decides safety** |
| AI proxy (optional) | `proxy/` | Cloudflare Worker that keeps the API key server-side and rate-limits |
| Rule engine (all decisions) | `app/rules.js` | Fact gate, product choice, quantities, compatibility, load limits, notices, evidence log, PLZ check and store search |
| Data | `app/data.js`, `app/data/` | Loads the Excel file (SheetJS), templates, word lists and the PLZ table – data files, not code |
| Texts | `app/i18n.js` | All UI texts in English (default) and German |
| Config | `app/config.js` | Data paths, AI mode, store distance and number of stores shown |

### Safety rules in code
- **Fact status (SR-01, SR-11):** every value is a *guess* (`observed`, from text or speech), *confirmed by you* (`user-confirmed`, tapped) or *manufacturer data*. Only the last two drive decisions.
- **Mounting gate (SR-03):** no wall plugs and no final mounting list until wall type **and** load are confirmed.
- **No certification (SR-02):** the app never says a wall can hold a load or is safe to drill. Every list that goes into the wall shows the **detector-limits notice** – detectors often miss plastic pipes; "nothing found" is no clearance (SR-05).
- **No adding up (SR-04):** every load-bearing part (board, bracket, plug, screw) must carry the whole load × 1.25 on its own; above 50 kg, or above 25 kg on plasterboard, the app stops.
- **Fail-safe (SR-06):** unknown, missing or contradictory data → stop with an explanation of what to check.
- **Manufacturer wins (SR-07):** the product's `safety_note` is shown unchanged; generated text that could weaken it is dropped.
- **Re-check (SR-08):** changing wall type, load, size or a product variant re-runs all checks.
- **Scope (SR-09):** high-risk work is refused before the AI is asked – the same for typed and spoken text.
- **Variants:** a look-alike but wrong screw, plug or drill bit is flagged as "does not fit"; an unclear pack size gives no total.
- **Store data:** stock and aisle/shelf only from the selected store – never invented, never from another store.

## Look and feel
DIY-store app style: white page, orange header band (**#FF7313**) with a diagonal
edge and the team's own **Baumarkt-Buddy logo** (house with hammer, `app/img/logo.png`) top left on a dark box, a small round language flag (32 px, tap area 44 px; German flag on the English screen, UK flag on the German screen – own inline SVG), condensed bold
headlines, black pill buttons and outlined secondary buttons, outlined project
tiles with line icons, flat product rows with big prices and an availability dot,
the total in a black price box, and a bottom tab bar (Start · Store · List).
Only general style cues – no logo, mascot, name or other brand assets of a real
company. Colour tokens are at the top of `app/style.css`. White text on #FF7313
would fail WCAG contrast (2.7:1), so text on orange is black and orange text uses
darker shades (#E05A00 for large bold text, #C85000 for normal text).

## Using the app
A **progress bar** under the header shows where the customer is: **Store → Project →
Questions → List → Shopping** (done steps orange, current step bold). A safety stop turns the step
where it happened red (e.g. "unknown wall" at Questions, high-risk work at Project).
It is hidden on the start notice.
**Tap a finished step to go back to it (issue #157):** finished steps are underlined buttons
("Go back to: Project"). *Store* opens the store search and returns to the screen you came from;
*Project* opens "What do you want to do?" with your text kept; *Questions* opens the first question
with your answers pre-filled; *List* (from shopping by aisle) opens the list. It works like tapping
Back several times, so answers are re-checked (SR-08) and browser back/forward keep working.
The current step and later steps cannot be tapped.

1. **Start:** notice about AI use, sample data, privacy and the browser speech service.
2. **Store (optional):** enter a postcode → sample stores within 50 km, nearest first → tap one. Or skip.
3. **Project:** describe it (type or 🎤) or tap one of the 6 project buttons (grouped, icon and title only). The safety level is shown at the top of the list and the template version at its end; the team review status is kept in the template files only, not shown in the app.
4. **Check:** "Did we understand you correctly?" – recognised values are guesses.
5. **Questions (max. 3 screens):** e.g. wall type, weight, sizes, condition checklists (mould, used-item defects) – guesses are pre-filled, you confirm by tapping. Stop rules from the catalogue (ST-01…ST-14) end the flow with a hand-off to staff or a specialist.
   **Weight (D-2, FR-04, SR-14):** "I know it", "Weigh it" (bathroom-scale tip), "Estimate for me" (shelf only: 1 kg per 4 cm of shelf for books, rule SHELF-E1 – shown as estimate, counts only after "Confirm") or "I don't know". *I don't know* plans for the project's worst case = its highest allowed load (shelf 50 kg, cabinet 50 kg, picture 25 kg, sliding door 60 kg; team decision 31 Oct 2026). If that worst case is above the wall's limit or no part can carry it, the app stops with ST-05 "please weigh it or ask OBI staff".
   **Size limits shown before input (3 Nov 2026):** every number field shows the limit of this guide, read from the project's stop rules (e.g. cabinet width up to 75 cm, room height up to 2.5 m, lock backset only 55 mm, rule ST-04) and, where a part's size depends on the answer, the sizes in our catalogue (shelf boards, sliding-door leaves). Typing a value beyond a limit shows a warning straight away. If the app stops for a size, the stop names the value given and the limit ("Length: your value 300 cm · this guide: up to 120 cm").
   **Several shelf boards (rule SHELF-S1):** a shelf longer than 120 cm can be built from several equal boards side by side (e.g. 300 cm → 3 boards of 100 cm). The choice appears under the length as soon as it is above 120 cm, and the size stop offers it as a button. Each board gets its own brackets, plugs and screws and is checked on its own for the **full** weight given – the weight is never divided (only the books estimate SHELF-E1 is per board). The list says to have longer boards cut to size in the store.
   **Several wall cabinets (rule CAB-S1):** the same for a wall cabinet wider than 75 cm (was 120 cm until 4 Nov 2026 – wall cabinets are sold up to 60–75 cm wide): several cabinets of the same width side by side (e.g. 150 cm → 2 cabinets of 75 cm). Each cabinet gets its own hanging rail, plugs and screws and is checked on its own for the full weight; depth, height and the plasterboard table (ST-03) are checked per cabinet. Cabinets of different widths are planned one by one. The texts of the split option come from the project template (`segments.texts`).
6. **List:** the **safety notes** (detector limits, wall not checked, warnings for your project and answers) are in one orange box at the top. It is open when the list appears and closes as soon as you scroll; then only "Safety notes (n)" and short labels stay visible – tap the title to open or close it again. A new project shows it open again (issue #144). The saved list and the shopping route always show the notes in full. Each section (Materials, Tools, Safety gear) starts with a **dark header band** with an orange icon, the name and the number of parts ("6 parts"); "Have it all" sits on the right of the band. **Tools** and **Safety gear** carry a smaller "(optional)" after the name – you only buy them if you do not have them yet; Materials do not (issue #168, also in the saved list). Mark parts you **already have** (button "Have it already" / "Hab ich schon" on the right of the price row – the item stays visible, marked, and is not counted; the page stays where you clicked and the focus stays on the button, issue #119; never for plugs and screws; a used load-bearing part with a reported defect stays on the list; own tools and safety gear get the hint "Keep the right tool and gear to ensure safety.", SR-17). **Tools** and **Safety gear** have a button **"Have it all" / "Hab ich alles"** beside the heading (from 2 parts that may be owned): it marks every part of that section at once and turns into "Buy all after all" / "Doch alles kaufen" (issue #145). Materials have no such button – plugs and screws always stay on the list. When every part of Tools or Safety gear is marked, the section folds to one green line "All in hand – n parts, not counted" with "Show items ▾" under the heading; the items, the subtotal and the hint "Keep the right tool …" appear again when shown (SR-17 deviation, team decision: `tpjm/change-proposal-CP-SR17-FOLD.md`). These buttons and "Change store" / "Enter postcode" (on the right of the store bar) are small outline pills; the touch target stays 44 px. Each section shows its **subtotal**; the total is the sum of the subtotals (FR-34). There is no tick box any more (D-3). Change a variant, your answers or the store, open the OBI how-to links (projects 5–9). "Why these products?" (second line "Evidence log", info circle on the left, arrow ▾/▴ on the right like the other open/close sections – issue #151) opens the evidence log.
7. **Save list (FR-17, DR-06):** "Save list" downloads one HTML file in the app design (orange header, safety notes first, one row per item with the price on the right, aisle and shelf as chips, subtotals, total box, items you already have in their own section, clickable how-to links – issue #135). It has no script and loads nothing from the internet, opens in any browser and can be printed to PDF. It contains products, quantities, prices, section subtotals and total, items you already have, aisle/shelf/stock of the chosen store, product warnings, safety notes and how-to links. It is built on the device – nothing is sent, your postcode is not in the file. Where the browser supports it, "Share list" opens the phone's share sheet with the same file.
8. **Shopping by aisle:** the orange button "Start shopping by aisle" under the list opens the same checked list sorted for the walk through the chosen store – grouped by aisle (ascending, numbered), within an aisle by shelf, with packs per item. Items you already have are left out; items the store cannot supply are listed under "Not on the route in this store" with the nearest store that has them or "please ask staff" (FR-31). Safety notices stay visible. Without a store the app asks for a postcode first. It only reorders the list – no tick boxes (D-3), no new decision.
9. **Back button and browser back (issue #101):** the bottom tab bar reads **Back · Start · Store · List**. "Back" does the same as the browser back and is always in reach, also on long lists and on question screens – so screens have no second back button of their own (question form: only "Confirm"; shopping by aisle: no "Back to the list"); it is greyed out on the first step, where it would leave the app. Browser back / back swipe goes one step back inside the app – list → last question → previous question → project choice; shopping by aisle → list; a question opened with "Change" → list. After choosing a store, back does not return to the store search. Forward shows the next step again, always re-checked from the current answers (SR-08). One more back on the first step while a list exists asks **"Leave your list?"** – *Save list* · *Stay in the app* · *Leave*. The browser history only holds the screen name and question id, never answers or the postcode (NFR-04). A reload or a tab closed by the phone still loses the list (no storage – open team question, option C in #101).

## AI adapter modes (`aiMode` in `app/config.js`)
| Mode | What it does | Cost |
|---|---|---|
| `template` **(default – team decision)** | Keyword matching with `data/understanding-lexicon.json`: intents, wall types, units and number words in DE/EN ("zwölf Kilo", "twelve kilos", "80x25 cm"). Tolerates spelling mistakes and word forms ("Regla", "Regall", "Bücherregla", "shefl" → shelf) – always only a guess the customer confirms | free |
| `proxy` | A commercial language model via `proxy/` – built, **not active**. Set `ai.proxyUrl` | API usage |
| `mock` | Fixed answers from `data/ai-mock-responses.json` for tests and demos; also via `app/index.html?ai=mock` | free |

**Spelling mistakes (template mode):** exact keywords are tried first; if none
matches, word forms and compounds ("Regale", "Eckregal") and words with one typo
("Regla", swapped letters count as one mistake; two from 9 letters) are accepted.
Only keywords with 5+ letters and the same first letter count, so short words like
"Bild" need the exact spelling. Real words that only look like a typo ("Frage" is
not "frame") are listed in `typo_exceptions` in the lexicon. If two projects could
be meant, the app shows the project buttons. Phrases are matched word by word
with one mistake per word ("stud wlal", "tragende Wnad"; 4-letter words only with
two swapped letters). The "Did we understand you correctly?" screen lists every
correction – e.g. *"regla" read as "Regal"* – so the customer can spot a wrong
guess (NFR-05). The high-risk check (SR-09) uses the same tolerance – "Steckdoze"
and "tragende Wnad" are refused like the correct spelling.

All modes return the same JSON (`intent`, `high_risk`, `facts`), which is validated
in code; anything unexpected is discarded. Exception for our own keyword code
(template mode, no AI): a single impossible value ("-5 kg", "0 kg", "9999 kg") is dropped
and asked again, the project is kept (issues #104, #105); AI answers stay all-or-nothing. If the AI fails, times out or answers
invalidly, the app offers the project buttons and keeps the text and the values
already recognised (NFR-03). Before text goes to the proxy, postcodes, phone numbers
and e-mail addresses are removed; only `text` and `lang` are sent (NFR-04).

## Voice input (FR-25, FR-27, SR-11)
First tap on 🎤 → in-app notice about the browser's speech service → "Allow
microphone" → the browser asks for permission → red recording indicator (stop by
tap or Esc) → live transcript in the text field → the customer checks or edits it
and taps **Continue**. Only then is the text processed. Spoken values are guesses
and are read back in the questions. Language follows the UI (`en-US` / `de-DE`).

| Browser | Voice input | Speech service (may receive the audio) |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome (desktop, Android) | yes | Google |
| Edge | yes | Microsoft |
| Safari (macOS, iOS) | yes (Siri/dictation must be enabled) | Apple |
| Firefox | **no** – hint shown; typing and buttons work | – |
| Other browsers on iOS | depends on the browser | Apple |

Needs HTTPS or `localhost`. Denied, missing or failing microphones show a hint;
typing and the project buttons always work.

**Manual check with real speech** (automated tests use a simulated speech API):
| # | Language | Say | Expected |
|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | EN | "I want to hang a shelf, twelve kilos, concrete wall, eighty centimetres long" | Shelf; 12 kg, concrete, 80 cm as guesses |
| S2 | DE | "Ich möchte ein Regal für zwölf Kilo an eine Betonwand hängen, 80 Zentimeter lang" | Regal; 12 kg, Beton, 80 cm als Vermutung |
| S3 | DE | "Zwei Bilder mit je drei Kilo an die Ziegelwand" | Bild; 3 kg, Ziegel, 2 Bilder |
| S4 | DE | "Ich will eine Steckdose versetzen" | Stop screen "needs a professional" |
| S5 | any | Deny the microphone in the browser prompt | Hint; typing and buttons work |

## Store selection by PLZ (FR-29, FR-30)
- The PLZ is checked in code: exactly 5 digits **and** present in the PLZ table. Spaces and other non-digits are removed while typing or pasting (" 91126" works, issue #109).
- Number answers accept only digits with one decimal comma or point ("4", "4,5", "4.5"); "1e1", "0x10" and the like are rejected (issue #108).
- Valid → stores within `store.maxDistanceKm` (50 km), sorted by straight-line distance, at most `store.maxStoresShown` (6 = all sample stores, D-8 / D-11), with address and opening hours.
- Invalid, unknown or no store in range → message plus the full store list.
- **A store is never selected automatically** – not even the nearest one or the only one in range; the customer taps it (RB-16, SR-06). *Team decision 25 Oct 2026: no preselection* – FR-29, design D-11 and TC-38 say the same.
- Skipped → the complete list with identical checks; aisle, shelf and stock show "not available" plus an "Add postcode" button.
- The PLZ stays on the device: never sent to the AI, never logged, cleared after the choice. Only the PLZ centre coordinates are kept in memory for referral distances (FR-31).
- If the PLZ table or store data fail to load, the app continues without a store.

## Availability in the chosen store (FR-31, RB-21)
- In the data, an **empty aisle** means the store does not carry the product; **qty 0** means it is out of stock.
- Such an item **always stays on the list**, marked "Not available in <store> (out of stock / not carried)". Quantities, checks and the total do not change.
- The app names the **nearest other sample store with qty > 0** within 50 km, measured from the entered PLZ (or from the chosen store if no PLZ was entered): "Available at <store> (x km) – referral". Only the store name and distance are shown – never the other store's aisle, shelf or stock (RB-15 exception, labelled as sample data).
- If no store nearby has it: "Not available in nearby stores – please ask staff". **No substitute product is ever suggested.**
- A summary line at the top of the list counts the items the store cannot supply.

## Run and test locally
The app loads its data files with `fetch` – including the team workbook in the
repository's `data/` folder – so serve the **repository root**:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000          # in the repository root
# app:   http://localhost:8000/app/
# tests: http://localhost:8000/app/tests.html   (summary at the top: 106 tests)
```
`tests.html` runs all automated tests in the browser against the real data files,
fixture copies of the catalogue, the AI `mock` mode and a simulated Web Speech API.
Without Python, `npx http-server -p 8000 -c-1` in the repository root does the same.

### Mounting logic D-13 / D-14 (released flow)
Since 5 Nov 2026 the new mounting logic is the **normal flow** of the app (no `?preview=d13` needed,
no preview bar). **http://localhost:8000/app/?logic=old** still shows the previous flow for comparison.
`tests.html` keeps the previous flow for its UI tests; the new calculation is tested via `BBPreviewD13.calc`.

- The app looks and works as usual (project page with free text and voice, all projects,
  store search, list with subtotals, "I already have this", availability and referral,
  shopping by aisle, save/share, facts with "Change", evidence log, back navigation).
- Only *Hang a shelf*, *Hang a wall cabinet* and *Anchor a shelf to the wall (anti-tip)* use the
  new flow **wall → size → summary → plug options "max. X kg" → confirm**; the result is shown on
  ("I don't know" as wall shows the hint *If you are not sure, choose "I don't know". We will not
  guess.* and stops with the same R-01 safety message as *Hang a picture*)
  the normal list screen. *Hang a picture* keeps its weight question (D-2) but offers the same wall
  choices (concrete, solid brick, perforated / unknown brick, aerated concrete, plasterboard, wood,
  I don't know): aerated concrete gets aerated-concrete plugs P213–P217 sized by the weight (their
  ratings from sheet *System ratings*), long screw and drill bit from sheet *Fixing chain*, no
  hammer mode; wood gets a screw in a pilot hole (no plug), max. 20 kg per picture. Painting and
  wallpaper are unchanged.
- **Used parts (C-7):** on the size screen, *Hang a shelf* and *Hang a wall cabinet* ask the same checklist
  as before ("Using an old board or brackets? / Used item? Tick any defect"). A ticked defect shows the
  warning "Please replace this part" on the list, and a used load-bearing part (board, bracket, rail,
  hangers) with a defect cannot be marked "Have it already" – it stays on the list (ST-06).
- Data: `data/product_catalogue_03_11_26.xlsx`; every load value from sheet *System
  ratings* (`BBRules.fixingChain` R-17, `BBRules.capacity` R-18); rail ratings from the
  rail products (80 / 150 kg, as in sheet *Cabinet*); 2 plugs per bracket.
- Store selection (6 stores incl. OBI Schwabach) with aisle and stock on the list; English and German.
- Code: `app/preview-d13.js` + `app/preview-d13.css`; settings in `app/config.js` → `preview.d13`.
  Stops only for wall "I don't know" and a wall cabinet too heavy for the wall; too deep → hint with the max. depth.
- **Size screen checks while you type:** the max. depth (and for a cabinet the max. width, 75 cm) is shown to
  the right of the field. As soon as all fields are filled, the size is checked without pressing
  *Continue*. A wall cabinet too heavy for the wall shows a notice on the same page: estimated weight,
  heaviest cabinet the wall takes (strongest plug ÷ 1.5), buttons with a height, width or depth that
  fits, and **"I'll weigh my cabinet"**. A weighed weight up to that max. leads to the plug options
  (contents = plug max. − weighed weight) and is named on the list; above it the app stops.
  The weighed-weight path is a proposal for the team (`tpjm/change-proposal-CP-D14-W.md`).

#### One-file trial for testers (no server, no git)
`node tools/build_trial.js` writes **`trial/Baumarkt-Buddy-Trial.html`**: the whole app (scripts,
styles, fonts, workbook, templates, PLZ table) in one file, with the D-13/D-14 logic on.
Send that file to a tester; they double-click it and it opens in their browser – no install, no
local server. Rebuild it after every change (the file is not in git).

### Save test results
The browser page shows the results only while it is open. To keep them as a file:
```bash
npm install --prefix tools                        # once: Playwright
npx --prefix tools playwright install chromium    # once: browser
node tools/run_tests.js                           # runs app/tests.html headless
```
The script starts its own local web server, runs the suite in headless Chromium and
writes `test/results/<date>_<commit>.md` (readable table) and `.json` (all details:
commit, branch, browser, every test). A file name ending in `-dirty` means the run
included uncommitted changes. Exit code 1 if a test fails. Every test run is saved and
its result files are committed with the change they test (team rule since 3 Nov 2026;
test log in `test/01_test_cases.md` §8.1).
Options: `--out <folder>`, `--no-save`.

**Automatically on GitHub:** `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs the same script on
every pull request into `main`, on every push to `main` and on demand (Actions →
Tests → *Run workflow*). The pull request shows a green or red **Tests** check; the
result table is in the run summary and the files can be downloaded as the artifact
`test-results` (kept 90 days).

## Publish on GitHub Pages
Settings → Pages → *Deploy from a branch* → `main`, folder `/ (root)` → Save.
The root `index.html` forwards to `app/`; `.nojekyll` serves files as they are.
No build step. To use the AI proxy on Pages, add the Pages origin to the proxy's
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

## Set up the AI proxy (optional)
See [`proxy/README.md`](proxy/README.md): Cloudflare Worker (free plan), API key as
Worker secret, CORS allowlist, 10 requests per minute per IP, logs off, structured
JSON output. Then set `aiMode: "proxy"` and `ai.proxyUrl` in `app/config.js`.

## Data and sources
All prices, stock levels, aisles and shelves are **sample data** and are labelled
as such in the app (DR-01, NFR-05). The store list says: *"Fictional partnership
for a university exam scenario. Aisles, shelves, stock and prices are sample data,
not real store data."* See [`data/README.md`](data/README.md) for the team's notes.

### `data/product_catalogue.xlsx` – the only product source (DR-01)
The team's workbook (exports: `products.csv`, `store_stock.csv`, `stores.csv`):

| Sheet | Content |
|---|---|
| `Products` | Product data once for all stores: `product_nr`, `product_name`, `category`, `size`, `description`, `material`, `colour`, `price_eur`, `max_load_kg`, `suitable_wall_types`, `compatible_with`, `use_cases`, `requires_professional`, `safety_note` – plus the **rule-engine columns** `variant_group`, `pack_qty` (pieces per sales unit; empty = unclear), `pack_unit`, `specs` (`key=value;…`, e.g. `diameter_mm=8`), `data_note` |
| `Store stock` | Per product and store: `<store_id>_aisle_nr`, `_aisle_name`, `_shelf_nr`, `_qty` (empty aisle = not carried, qty 0 = out of stock) |
| `Stores` | 6 stores (incl. SCH – OBI Schwabach, D-11): `store_id`, `store_name`, `street`, `plz`, `city`, `opening_hours`, `lat`, `lon` |
| `Fixing chain`, `System ratings`, `Capacity`, `Cabinet`, `Anti-tip`, `D-13 mapping` | New in data v3 (3 Nov 2026) for the shelf / wall-cabinet / anti-tip logic (D-13, D-14). All load values come from *System ratings* (sample until the fischer recommended loads are entered). The app reads *System ratings* and *Fixing chain* into `data.mounting` (`BBData.buildMounting`; a missing table or value → `data.mountingError`, no guessed values). The rule engine uses them in `BBRules.fixingChain` (R-17: wall → plug type and hammer mode, plug size → screw Ø → smallest bracket with screw Ø ≤ hole − 0.5 mm) and `BBRules.capacity` (R-18: MIN(system × f, bracket pair or rail × f, board) ÷ 1.25, capped by the wall cap, rounded down). No screen uses them yet. *Capacity* and *Cabinet* are the reference tables the tests compare against (TC-108). The mapping of a fixing type to its plug product group is in `app/config.js` → `mounting.fixingTypes`. |

The app finds the header row in each sheet (title rows above it are fine) and
skips legend or note rows. The rule-engine columns are added or refreshed with
`python3 tools/add_rule_columns.py`, which also re-exports `products.csv`; all other
cells stay as the team wrote them. Added for the app: `suitable_wall_types` of P051
(picture hooks) = brick, plasterboard – **team to verify** (noted in `data_note`).

### Other data files (`app/data/`)
| File | Content |
|---|---|
| `templates/*.json` | The 9 project templates (DR-04, `project_id` PRJ-01…PRJ-09), translated from `data/project_catalogue.xlsx`: questions, stop rules, warnings, limits (e.g. plasterboard cabinet table), quantity rules, which parts may be owned, how-to links, rule IDs, review status (`pending_team_review` – set `status`, `reviewed_by`, `review_date` after the team review, SR-10). When the catalogue changes, update the matching template and its tests. |
| `safety-rules.json` | Clearance phrases (SR-02), weakening phrases (SR-07), high-risk keywords (SR-09) |
| `understanding-lexicon.json` | Words for the keyword mode (intents, wall types, units, number words DE/EN) |
| `ai-mock-responses.json` | Fixed AI answers for the `mock` mode and tests |

### PLZ reference table `data/plz_coordinates.csv` (DR-08)
| | |
|---|---|
| Content | 8,298 German postcodes → centre coordinates (`plz,lat,lon`) |
| Source | **plz_geocoord** by Markus Konrad, Wissenschaftszentrum Berlin für Sozialforschung (WZB), January 2019 – <https://github.com/WZBSocialScienceCenter/plz_geocoord> (chosen by the data team, see `data/README.md`) |
| Licence | Apache License 2.0 |

### Third-party code
Fonts: Barlow and Barlow Condensed (SIL Open Font License 1.1, `app/fonts/OFL-Barlow.txt`),
self-hosted in `app/fonts/` from the `@fontsource` packages – no request to a font CDN.

`app/lib/xlsx.mini.min.js` – SheetJS Community Edition 0.18.5 (Apache-2.0,
`app/lib/SHEETJS-LICENSE.txt`), stored in the repo so the app needs no CDN. 0.18.5 has
known advisories for *untrusted* files; the app only reads its own data file.
Newer versions are on cdn.sheetjs.com.

## Timeline
2-week MVP sprint starting 19 Oct 2026 → final pitch.

## Limitations
Sample catalogue (288 products, data v3), invented prices, stock and aisle positions, 6 sample
stores in a fictional partnership scenario (addresses and opening hours to be verified
by the team), approximate PLZ distances, 9 project templates not yet reviewed by the team.
Aerated concrete and wood are built for the shelf, wall cabinet, anti-tip (aerated only) and
picture; the other projects still stop on aerated concrete (ST-02). "Estimate for me" exists
only for the shelf (other projects: no team estimate rule yet); cavity anchors and anchor bolts are assumed to bring their
own screw; the sliding-door plug (10 mm, 50 kg) limits the door to 40 kg although the
catalogue allows 60 kg (every part must carry the whole load × 1.25, SR-04).
Sliding door sizes: the door leaf must be at least 6 cm wider and 3 cm taller than
the opening (3 cm overlap per side and at the top) and must fit the free wall beside
the opening – the overlap values are common DIY rules of thumb (**assumption, team
to check**). With the two sample leaves (90 × 203.5 cm, 100 × 213.5 cm) openings up
to 94 × 210 cm are covered. Size stops show "needed vs. available" in cm.
Quantities are estimates. The app does not replace advice from a qualified person.
