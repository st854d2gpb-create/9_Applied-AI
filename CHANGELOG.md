# Changelog – Baumarkt-Buddy

All notable changes to this project are documented here.
Entries are collected under "Unreleased" and grouped into a milestone
when they are released to `main`.

## Unreleased

## Milestone: Competitor analysis – 2026-10-31
Summary (same as the pull request):
- New `docs/competitor-analysis.md`: German DIY market figures, direct and indirect competitors and their strategies
- Feature comparison table and what it means for the Baumarkt Buddy pitch, with sources
- README folder table lists `docs/`

- **2026-10-31 – Competitor analysis.** New `docs/competitor-analysis.md`: German
  DIY market figures (BHB 2025), direct competitors (Home Depot, Lowe's, Kingfisher,
  OBI, Hornbach, Bauhaus, toom), indirect competitors, a feature comparison and what
  it means for our pitch, with sources. README folder table lists `docs/`.
  *Why:* the team needs to know the competitors and their strategies for the pitch.
  *Prompt:* "Run market research on our competitors and their strategies; put
  everything in an md file under docs."

## Milestone: Shopping by aisle – 2026-10-31
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Orange button "Start shopping by aisle" under the list opens a new screen: the checked list of the chosen store grouped by aisle (ascending) and shelf
- Owned items left out; unavailable items listed separately with the FR-31 referral or "ask staff"; without a store → postcode prompt
- Progress bar gets a fifth step "Shopping"; 1 new test (107 passing)

- **2026-10-31 – Shopping by aisle.** New `aisleRoute` / `viewShopping` in
  `app/app.js` (screen `shopping`), button `#start-shopping` below the total, styles
  `.btn.brand` (black text on #FF7313 for WCAG contrast) and `.route` in `app/style.css`,
  texts EN/DE in `app/i18n.js`. The route only reorders the checked result (no tick
  boxes, D-3). Progress bar extended to five steps (Shopping). README updated.
  *Why:* in the store the customer wants to walk the aisles in order.
  *Prompt:* "Please add a button 'Shopping by aisle' below our list."

## Milestone: Progress bar over the flow – 2026-10-31
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Progress bar under the header: Store → Project → Questions → List (done = orange, current = bold)
- A safety stop marks its step red; hidden on the start notice; screen-reader labels for each step

- **2026-10-31 – Progress bar.** New `renderProgress` / `viewProgress` in
  `app/app.js` and `#progress` in `app/index.html`: four steps Store, Project,
  Questions, List mapped from the current screen; a safety stop (high-risk work,
  stop screen) is shown red at its step. Texts EN/DE, `aria-current="step"` and
  hidden status words for screen readers. 1 new test (106 passing).
  *Why:* customers should see where they are in the flow, like in other DIY-store apps.
  *Prompt:* "Can you add a status bar like this to our app, following our process?"

## Milestone: Team decisions D-1, D-2, D-3 – save list, weight answers, subtotals – 2026-10-31
Summary (same as the pull request):
- D-1 (FR-17, DR-06): "Save list" downloads the complete list as a text file on the device (optional share sheet); no PLZ, nothing sent
- D-2 (FR-04, SR-14): weight answers "I know it", "Weigh it", "Estimate for me" (shelf) and "I don't know" → worst case = project maximum; above the limit → ST-05 weigh / ask staff
- D-3 (FR-07, FR-34, SR-17): tick box removed; subtotal per section, total = sum of subtotals; hint for own tools and safety gear
- Tests: RB-23 updated to the new expectation; TC-100…TC-104 automated (105 passing)

- **2026-10-31 – Team decisions D-1, D-2 and D-3 implemented.**
  *D-1:* `buildListText` / `saveList` in `app/app.js` – the list (products, quantities,
  prices, subtotals, total, owned items, aisle/shelf/stock of the chosen store, product
  warnings, safety notes, how-to links) is saved as a local `.txt` file; "Share list"
  where the browser supports sharing files. The customer's PLZ is not included (store
  address without postcode); no network request.
  *D-2:* weight question offers "I know it", "Weigh it" (bathroom-scale tip), "Estimate
  for me" (shelf only, books rule SHELF-E1 = 1 kg per 4 cm, from the existing help
  text; labelled, used only after Confirm) and "I don't know". The rule engine then
  uses the project's highest allowed load as worst case (team decision 31 Oct 2026)
  and stops with ST-05 if the wall limit is lower or no part carries it; a list for the
  worst case carries a notice.
  *D-3:* the "in basket" tick box is removed; "I already have this" stays; section
  subtotals (FR-34) and total = sum of subtotals (RB-24); hint "Keep the right tool and
  gear to ensure safety." for own tools and safety gear (SR-17).
  Tests: SR-14 / RB-23 rewritten for D-2; new TC-100/101, TC-102, TC-103, TC-104
  (105 passing). README updated.
  *Why:* team decisions of 29 Oct 2026 (requirements FR-04, FR-07, FR-17, FR-34,
  SR-14, SR-17, DR-06); D-5 and D-11 wait for team data.
  *Prompt:* "Yes, implement D-1, D-2 and D-3" (worst case = project maximum, estimate
  only for the shelf with the books rule).

## Milestone: Dated test case copy moved to the archive – 2026-10-31
Summary (same as the pull request):
- `test/01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md` moved to `test/archive/`
- README now names `test/01_test_cases.md` as the current test cases and test log (§8.1); link in `tpjm/change-proposal-R1.md` updated

- **2026-10-31 – Moved `test/01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md` to `test/archive/`.**
  `git mv` keeps its history. The README points to `test/01_test_cases.md`
  (v1.2, 29 Oct 2026) as the current test cases and test log (§8.1); the link
  in `tpjm/change-proposal-R1.md` points to the archive path. Archived files
  and older CHANGELOG entries are unchanged.
  *Why:* the team wants the dated copy out of the active test folder.
  *Prompt:* "Move 01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md to test/archive."

## Milestone: Dated requirement copies moved to the archive – 2026-10-31
Summary (same as the pull request):
- `requirements-R1-MVP_2026-10-27.md` and `requirements-R2-R4_2026-10-27.md` moved to `requirements/archive/`
- Links in README, `tpjm/change-proposal-R1.md` and `test/01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md` updated

- **2026-10-31 – Moved the dated requirement copies to `requirements/archive/`.**
  `git mv` keeps their history. The README now links the R2–R4 requirements to
  `requirements/requirements-R2-R4.md`; the links in `tpjm/change-proposal-R1.md` and
  the basis references in `test/01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md` point to the archive
  path so they do not break. Older CHANGELOG entries keep their original wording.
  *Why:* the team wants the dated copies out of the active requirements folder.
  *Prompt:* "Move requirements-R2-R4_2026-10-27.md and requirements-R1-MVP_2026-10-27.md
  to requirements/archive."

## Milestone: Typo-tolerant project recognition – 2026-10-28
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Misspelled project and wall words are recognised in keyword mode ("Regla", "Regall", "Bücherregla", "shefl", "Gipskarten") – still only a guess the customer confirms
- Misspelled dangerous jobs are refused like correct ones ("Steckdoze", "Gastherne")
- Exception list for real words that only look like a typo ("Frage" is not "frame")
- "Did we understand you?" screen names each corrected word ("regla" read as "Regal")
- Misspelled phrases recognised word by word, incl. dangerous ones ("tragende Wnad", "load bearnig wall")

- **2026-10-28 – Typo hint on the recognised screen and phrase typos.**
  `templateUnderstand` reports every tolerated spelling mistake (not part of the
  validated AI output); the recognised screen lists them under "Possible spelling
  mistakes" (NFR-05). New `phraseTypoMatch` in `app/rules.js` matches phrases word
  by word (one mistake per word, word forms, two swapped letters in 4-letter words)
  – used for project and wall phrases ("stud wlal") and for the high-risk check
  ("tragende Wnad", "wand entfrenen", "verdeckte Leitnug"). 2 new tests (101 passing).
  *Why:* the customer should see what the app corrected, and dangerous phrases
  must also be caught when misspelled.
  *Prompt:* "Yes, add 1 and 3 to #93" (1 = "Did you mean …?" hint, 3 = phrase typos).

- **2026-10-28 – Typo tolerance for project, wall and high-risk words.**
  New `editDistance` / `typoMatch` in `app/rules.js` (swapped letters count as one
  mistake; keywords of 5+ letters, same first letter, 1 mistake – 2 from 9 letters).
  `app/ai-adapter.js` (template mode) tries exact keywords first, then word forms
  and compounds ("Regale", "Eckregal", "Regalbretter") and spelling mistakes; two
  possible projects → "unclear" (project buttons). The result stays a guess shown on
  "Did we understand you correctly?" and confirmed in the questions (SR-01). The
  G0 high-risk check also catches misspelled single keywords – a false hit only
  makes the app more careful (SR-09). New `typo_exceptions` list in
  `app/data/understanding-lexicon.json`. 2 new tests (99 passing).
  *Why:* a misspelled "Regla" instead of "Regal" was not recognised.
  *Prompt:* "How can I avoid that the project is not found when it is misspelled,
  e.g. 'regla' instead of 'regal'?"

## Milestone: Saved test results and automatic test runs – 2026-10-27
Summary (same as the pull request):
- `tools/run_tests.js` runs `app/tests.html` headless and saves `test/results/<date>_<commit>.md` / `.json`
- GitHub Actions workflow *Tests* on every pull request into `main`, push to `main` and on demand (run summary + artifact)
- First saved result: 97/97 PASS; README and test document §8 explain where results are stored

- **2026-10-27 – Test results are saved as files and run automatically on GitHub.**
  New `tools/run_tests.js` (with `tools/package.json`, Playwright 1.63.0): serves the
  repository itself, runs `app/tests.html` in headless Chromium and writes
  `test/results/<date>_<commit>.md` and `.json` (commit, branch, browser, every test);
  exit code 1 on a failed test. New workflow `.github/workflows/tests.yml` runs it on
  every pull request into `main`, every push to `main` and on demand – result in the
  run summary, files as artifact `test-results` (90 days). `.gitignore` for
  `tools/node_modules/` and `tools/package-lock.json` (otherwise every CI run was
  marked `-dirty`). README and test document §8 explain where results are stored.
  *Why:* results were only visible in the open browser tab and in hand-written logs.
  *Prompt:* "Where are test results stored? – Yes, implement the runner script and CI."

## Milestone: Requirements and test cases updated to the current app – 2026-10-27
Summary (same as the pull request):
- New dated files `requirements-R1-MVP_2026-10-27.md`, `requirements-R2-R4_2026-10-27.md`, `01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md` (originals kept)
- R1: 49 requirements – 9 projects, stop rules and size stops, FR-07 moved from R2, new FR-32, FR-33, SR-13 … SR-16 (proposed, team to confirm)
- R2–R4: FR-07 removed, R1 parts of FR-10/12/14/16 noted, open points of the session listed
- Test cases v1.1: TC-080 … TC-099, automated suite and results documented, traceability 49/49, RB-23 proposed
- 2 new automated tests (unknown load, high-risk filter in Basic projects); 97 passing

- **2026-10-27 – Requirements and test cases updated to the current app (new dated files).**
  New files `requirements/requirements-R1-MVP_2026-10-27.md`,
  `requirements/requirements-R2-R4_2026-10-27.md` and `test/01_test_cases_2026-10-27.md`
  (originals kept). R1: 49 requirements (41 Must / 8 Should) – 9 projects (DR-04), stop
  rules and size stops (FR-15), FR-07 moved from R2, new FR-32 (how-to links), FR-33
  (used-item defects), SR-13 … SR-16 from the project catalogue (all new rows
  *Proposed*, team to confirm). R2–R4: FR-07 removed, R1 parts of FR-10/12/14/16 noted,
  open points of the session listed. Test cases v1.1: new TC-080 … TC-099 for the
  project catalogue, automated suite documented with its results, traceability 49/49,
  RB-21 linked to FR-31, RB-23 added (proposed). Two automated tests added so that
  every "Auto" reference is real: SR-14 / RB-23 (unknown load stops) and SR-16 / SR-09
  (high-risk filter in Basic projects) – 97 passing. Archive data not used.
  *Why:* the documents still described 2 projects and 70 products.
  *Prompt:* "Update the R1, R2–R4 requirements and the test cases to the vibe coding
  session and the current app; save under the same names plus today's date."

## Milestone: Sliding door dimensions and second door leaf – 2026-10-27
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Sliding door leaf must overlap the opening (+3 cm per side and at the top, assumption) and fit the free wall beside the opening; opening height is checked
- New question "free wall beside the opening"; stop ST-04 when there is not enough wall
- New sample door leaf P105 (100 × 213.5 cm); P097 gets its height as a spec
- Size stops show "needed vs. available" in cm (also shelf boards) and hand off to store staff only
- 95 tests passing

- **2026-10-27 – Sliding door: realistic dimensions and a second door leaf.**
  The door leaf now has to be at least opening + 6 cm wide and opening + 3 cm tall
  (3 cm overlap per side and at the top – assumption, team to check); the opening
  height is checked at last; a new question asks for the free wall beside the
  opening (the leaf must fit there, otherwise stop ST-04 with the needed width). New
  sample leaf P105 (1000 x 2135 mm, 30 kg, 179 €, stock in all 5 stores, team to
  verify); P097 got the spec `height_mm=2035` from its size. Size stops now show
  "needed vs. available" in the unit of the question (cm, German number format) –
  also for shelf boards – and hand off to store staff only (no extra
  "qualified professional" line). Engine: `spec_lte`, `size_check` per role.
  4 new/updated tests (95 passing).
  *Why:* the sliding-door stop mixed cm and mm, ignored the height and allowed leaves
  without overlap.
  *Prompt:* "The dimension differences make little sense – implement it, with a second door leaf."

## Milestone: 120 cm shelf boards and clear size stop – 2026-10-27
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Stop screen names a size problem (part and catalogue sizes) instead of blaming the load
- New 120 cm shelf boards P103 (25 cm deep) and P104 (20 cm deep), sample values – shelves up to 120 cm with 3 brackets
- 93 tests passing

- **2026-10-27 – Second 120 cm shelf board P104 (20 cm deep).**
  P104 *Shelf board 1200 x 200 x 18 mm* (rated 20 kg like P063, 17.99 €, brackets
  P058/P059, stock in all 5 stores – sample values, team to verify) added to the
  workbook (stock row inserted above the legend); CSVs re-exported. Shelves of
  81–120 cm now work in both depths. Test R-07 (size) uses a catalogue copy without
  P104, because the real catalogue no longer has a size gap up to 120 cm (93 passing).
  *Why:* 20 cm deep shelves above 80 cm still stopped.
  *Prompt:* "Yes, also add a 120 cm board with 20 cm depth."

- **2026-10-27 – New 120 cm shelf board P103 in the product catalogue.**
  `data/product_catalogue.xlsx` gets P103 *Shelf board 1200 x 250 x 18 mm* (rated
  25 kg, 19.99 €, compatible with brackets P059/P060, stock in all 5 stores – price,
  rating and stock are sample values, team to verify); CSVs re-exported. Shelves of
  81–120 cm with 25 cm depth now get a list with 3 brackets (project catalogue PRJ-01:
  3 brackets up to 120 cm). 20 cm deep shelves above 80 cm still stop with the size
  message. New test PRJ-01 / P103 (93 passing).
  *Why:* 100–120 cm shelves were impossible with the 80 cm boards only.
  *Prompt:* "Add a 120 cm shelf board with a load rating."

- **2026-10-27 – Stop screen names a size problem instead of blaming the load.**
  A 100 cm shelf with 10 kg was stopped with "no product combination rated for this
  load and wall", although the only reason was the board length (catalogue boards are
  80 cm). If a part fails only on its size checks, the stop now says which part and
  lists the catalogue sizes (EN + DE); real load problems keep the old text. New test
  R-07 (size), 92 passing.
  *Why:* the message was misleading for customers.
  *Prompt:* "A shelf with 10 kg and 20 cm deep is over the limit? That makes no sense."

## Milestone: Product catalogue v2 and project catalogue – 9 projects – 2026-10-27
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Product catalogue v2 (102 products, German names) and project catalogue (draft v1) added to `data/`
- `tools/add_rule_columns.py` only fills empty cells (keeps team values) and exports all three CSVs
- 7 new project templates (wall cabinet, anti-tip, paint, glass door, door lock, sliding door, wallpaper); shelf and picture aligned with the catalogue
- Rule engine: stop rules ST-01…ST-14 and warnings from the templates, conditions, new quantity rules, plasterboard cabinet table, projects without load questions, "I already have this" (C-8, SR-15)
- UI: grouped project buttons with safety level, checklist questions, catalogue stop texts, OBI how-to links, German product names
- Lexicon, AI schema and proxy know the new projects and wall types; 91 tests passing

- **2026-10-27 – Product catalogue v2 and project catalogue added to the repository.**
  `data/product_catalogue.xlsx` replaced by the team's v2 (102 products P001–P102,
  German names `product_name_de`/`category_de`, stock for the new products in all
  5 stores, sheets *Read Me* and *Translations*). New `data/project_catalogue.xlsx`
  (draft v1, 9 projects, team review pending). `tools/add_rule_columns.py` now only
  fills **empty** rule-engine cells (it used to overwrite `specs`/`pack_qty`, which
  would have destroyed v2 values such as `coverage_m2_per_l` and the 2-pc hinge
  set), adds `volume_l` to the wall paints, and exports all three CSVs
  (`products.csv`, `store_stock.csv`, `stores.csv`). The app shows the German product
  name in German mode. Tests: fixture product number moved from P097 (now a real
  product) to P997; DR-01 count raised to ≥ 100; new test for German names (70 passing).
  *Why:* the team delivered updated catalogues that belong in git (DR-01, DR-04).
  *Prompt:* "I have an updated project and product catalogue – push them and update the app."

- **2026-10-27 – App updated to the project catalogue: 9 projects (PRJ-01…PRJ-09).**
  New templates in `app/data/templates/`: wall cabinet (incl. the plasterboard limit
  table), anti-tip kit, paint a wall (litres from coverage, mould checks), glass door
  (hinge rating from the door weight), interior door lock (type and size must match),
  sliding door (rail ≥ 2 × leaf, moving load only on concrete/solid brick) and nonwoven
  wallpaper (roll calculation). Shelf and picture aligned: wall types *solid brick*,
  *brick (type unknown)* (max. 25 kg for shelves) and *aerated concrete* (stop ST-02),
  shelf length > 120 cm stops (ST-04), used-item defect checklist. Rule engine: stop
  rules and warnings from the templates (fail safe if a value is missing), conditions,
  new quantity expressions (add/sub/div/floor/ceil/min/table/"unclear"), projects
  without load or wall questions, "I already have this" for allowed parts (C-8, never
  plugs/screws, refused for defective load-bearing parts – ST-06, SR-15). UI: grouped
  project buttons with icons and safety level, checklist questions, catalogue stop
  texts with hand-off, OBI how-to links (https + allow-listed hosts only, English
  subtitles requested in EN mode). Keyword lexicon, AI schema and proxy prompt know the
  new projects and wall types. 91 tests passing (21 new).
  *Why:* the team's project catalogue defines the 9 Release-1 projects (DR-04).
  *Prompt:* "push them and update the app."

## Milestone: Design update 2 and store availability (FR-31) – 2026-10-25
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Layout and fonts reworked after screenshots of a DIY-store app: orange header band with diagonal edge, condensed headlines, black pill buttons, outlined tiles, flat product rows, black price box, bottom tab bar
- Self-hosted Barlow / Barlow Condensed fonts (OFL)
- Own neutral toolbox mark instead of the "B"; no logo or mascot of a real company
- FR-31: unavailable items stay on the list, marked, with referral to the nearest store with stock or "please ask staff"; no substitutes
- App switched to the team workbook `data/product_catalogue.xlsx` (5 stores) and `data/plz_coordinates.csv`; rule-engine columns added
- TC-38 without store preselection (team decision); FR-29, D-11 and TC-38 in the team documents aligned; 69 tests passing

- **2026-10-25 – FR-31: availability in the chosen store and referral; app switched to the team workbook.**
  The app now reads the team's `data/product_catalogue.xlsx` (5 stores, sheet
  "Store stock") and `data/plz_coordinates.csv` (WZB, Apache-2.0) as required by
  DR-01/DR-08; header rows, legend and note rows are handled. The rule-engine
  columns (`variant_group`, `pack_qty`, `pack_unit`, `specs`, `data_note`) were
  added to the *Products* sheet by the new `tools/add_rule_columns.py` (other cells
  unchanged; P051 wall types filled, flagged). Removed the superseded
  `app/data/baumarkt-buddy-data.xlsx`, `app/data/plz-de.csv` and their build
  scripts. New `availability()` in `rules.js`: an out-of-stock or not-carried item
  stays on the list, marked, with the nearest other store with qty > 0 (from the
  PLZ centre, ≤ 50 km) or "please ask staff"; never a substitute. Store list shows
  address, opening hours and a fictional-partnership/sample-data note. TC-38 is
  implemented **without preselection** (RB-16). Tests updated to the 5 stores and
  extended by TC-34…TC-38, RB-21 (69 passing). README and data/README updated;
  local testing now serves the repository root.
  *Why:* team requirement FR-31 (round 5) and DR-01 data merge.
  *Prompt:* "Yes, implement FR-31, TC-38 without preselection."

- **2026-10-25 – Team documents aligned with "no store preselection":** FR-29 text
  and simple-language column (`requirements/requirements-R1-MVP.md`, plus a round-6
  team comment), design element D-11 (`data/03-design.md`) and TC-38
  (`test/01_test_cases.md`) now say: stores listed nearest first, the customer taps
  one, nothing is preselected (SR-06, RB-16).
  *Why:* the documents still described an automatic preselection that the team
  decided against.
  *Prompt:* "Yes, update the team documents."
- **2026-10-25 – Design update 2: DIY-store app layout and fonts.**
  `app/style.css` rewritten: white page; orange #FF7313 header band with diagonal
  edge, title in a white box, round language button and toolbox mark; Barlow
  Condensed headlines and buttons, Barlow body text (self-hosted, OFL); black
  pill primary buttons and outlined secondary buttons; text field in a pill
  search-field look with a black round microphone button; project buttons as
  outlined tiles with line icons; flat product rows with big prices and small
  cents, availability dot (green = in stock); total in a black price box; bottom
  tab bar Start · Store · List (new `renderNav` in `app.js`). Contrast kept
  (black on orange, darker orange for text). The requested OBI beaver image was
  not used: it is a trademark and mascot of a real company.
  *Why:* the team wants the look of a familiar DIY-store app.
  *Prompt:* "These are screenshots of the OBI app, please adapt fonts / layout /
  design accordingly" and "put the beaver / the photo instead of the B".

## Milestone: Design update – brand orange #FF7313 – 2026-10-25
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Brand orange changed to #FF7313 and app look modernised in a clean DIY-store app style
- Accessible colour use: dark text on orange buttons, darker orange for text
- Compact phone header with the sample-data badge under the title

- **2026-10-25 – Design: brand orange #FF7313, DIY-store app look.**
  New colour tokens in `app/style.css` (brand #FF7313, pressed #E85F00, soft
  #FFF1E6, orange text #B84A00); white header with orange bottom line and
  brand mark; pill-shaped buttons; white cards with soft shadows on a light
  grey page; round icon tiles for the project buttons; orange section markers.
  Dark text on orange (6.4:1) because white on #FF7313 only reaches 2.7:1
  (WCAG needs 4.5:1). Sample-data badge moved under the title so the phone
  header fits from 320 px. Only general style cues of DIY-store apps – no logo,
  name or other brand assets of a real company.
  *Why:* the team wants the app to look like a familiar DIY-store app.
  *Prompt:* "Design changes: please change the orange to hex #FF7313 and take
  the OBI app design as orientation."

## Milestone: Release 1 (MVP) – Baumarkt-Buddy web app – 2026-10-25
Summary (same as the pull request):
- Static web app in `app/` (HTML/CSS/vanilla JS, no build step) for GitHub Pages
- Single Excel data file with products, 3 sample stores and per-store stock/aisles; PLZ table from OpenGeoDB
- Deterministic rule engine with 2 project templates (hang a shelf, hang a picture) and all R1 safety rules
- Free-text entry with exchangeable AI adapter (template default, mock, optional proxy) and template fallback
- Voice input (German/English) with consent, editable transcript and confirmation by tap
- Optional PLZ store selection that never selects a store automatically; full list without a store
- English/German UI, transparency notices, evidence log
- 62 automated tests in `tests.html`, including all 14 release-blocking tests of R1

- **2026-10-25 – R1 stage 1: data model, rule engine, templates, safety rules, tests.**
  Added the static app in `app/` (index.html, style.css, app.js, rules.js,
  data.js, i18n.js, config.js, tests.html), the single sample data file
  `app/data/baumarkt-buddy-data.xlsx` (Products, Stores, Stock; 3 sample stores)
  built by `tools/build_sample_data.py`, the templates "Hang a shelf" and
  "Hang a picture" with rule IDs and review status, safety word lists, vendored
  SheetJS, and 32 automated tests (RB-01, -03, -04, -06, -07, -08, -09, -13,
  -15, -17, SR-11 and more). README documents architecture, data schema and testing.
  *Why:* first stage of Release 1 – deterministic, safety-first core before AI,
  voice and PLZ are added.
  *Prompt:* "Build Release 1 (MVP) of Baumarkt-Buddy in stages; stage 1 = data
  model, Excel loading, rule engine, 2 templates, safety rules and tests (buttons only)."
- **2026-10-25 – Documented language decision:** English stays the default UI
  language, German via the toggle (config.js comment, README).
  *Why:* NFR-09 in the requirements says "German default"; the team confirmed
  English, so the deviation is recorded.
  *Prompt:* "English is still fine."
- **2026-10-25 – R1 stage 2: free text, AI adapter, follow-up questions, fallback.**
  Added `app/ai-adapter.js` with the modes `template` (default, keyword matching,
  no AI), `mock` (fixed test answers) and `proxy`; strict schema validation of
  every answer; G0 high-risk check before the AI; "Did we understand you?" screen
  and pre-filled guesses that must be confirmed; fallback to the templates that
  keeps the text and recognised values; redaction of PLZ/phone/e-mail. Added the
  optional Cloudflare Worker in `proxy/` (API key as secret, CORS allowlist,
  rate limit, logs off, structured JSON output). 10 new tests (42 passing).
  *Why:* stage 2 of Release 1. Team decision: no paid AI for R1 – default mode is
  `template`; the proxy is built but not active (option a).
  *Prompt:* "We thought we'd use option 1: dictation only (free) … a) please, then
  continue with stage 2."
- **2026-10-25 – CODEOWNERS covers `proxy/` and `tools/`:** changes to the AI
  proxy and the data build script need approval by @st854d2gpb-create.
  *Why:* the proxy handles the API key setup and rate limits; it is app code.
  *Prompt:* "Yes, add CODEOWNERS and continue with stage 3."
- **2026-10-25 – R1 stage 3: voice input (German and English).**
  Added `app/speech.js` (browser Web Speech API, `de-DE`/`en-US`, interim
  results) and the microphone button next to the text field: in-app consent
  naming the browser speech service, recording indicator, stop by tap or Esc,
  live editable transcript that is only processed after tapping "Continue",
  spoken values as guesses with read-back, hints for unsupported browsers and
  denied/failed microphones. Privacy notice on the start screen names the
  speech services. 10 new tests with a simulated speech API (52 passing),
  including RB-18, RB-19 and RB-20; manual real-speech checklist in README.
  *Why:* stage 3 of Release 1 (FR-25, FR-27, SR-11, NFR-04).
  *Prompt:* "Yes, add CODEOWNERS and continue with stage 3."
- **2026-10-25 – R1 stage 4: PLZ and store selection, path without a store.**
  Added the PLZ reference table `app/data/plz-de.csv` (8,216 postcodes, OpenGeoDB
  0.2.5a, public domain) built by `tools/build_plz_table.py`; store coordinates
  in the Excel file now come from this table. New optional store screen: PLZ
  checked in code (5 digits + in table), stores within 50 km sorted by distance
  (max. 5), otherwise message + full list; a store is only ever selected by tap.
  Shopping list shows the chosen store with "Change store", or "Add postcode"
  without one. PLZ stays on the device. Missing PLZ table or store sheets → app
  continues without a store. 8 new tests (60 passing, none pending).
  *Why:* stage 4 of Release 1 (FR-29, FR-30, DR-08, RB-16). Team confirmed
  50 km / 5 stores and OpenGeoDB as PLZ source.
  *Prompt:* "Fine as is, use OpenGeoDB and continue with stage 4."
- **2026-10-25 – R1 stage 5: polish, transparency, README, GitHub Pages entry.**
  Responsive audit at 320/390/768/1280 px (header wraps on very small phones,
  two-column list on laptops, no overflow, all touch targets ≥ 44 px); "How this
  list was made" note with the template's review status; root `index.html`
  forwarding to `app/` and `.nojekyll` for GitHub Pages; README rewritten
  (description, architecture, usage, AI modes, voice support, store selection,
  local testing, Pages, proxy, data sources incl. PLZ licence, full table
  requirement → implementation → test). 2 new tests (62 passing).
  *Why:* stage 5 of Release 1 (NFR-01, NFR-05, NFR-09, delivery).
  *Prompt:* "Yes, continue with stage 5."

## Milestone: App code ownership – 2026-10-25
- **2026-10-25 – Added .github/CODEOWNERS:** @st854d2gpb-create owns the
  app code (`app/`, `APP`), deployment and repo config (`.github/`) and
  `CLAUDE.md`.
  *Why:* only the project lead should approve changes to the app; the team
  can keep reviewing requirements, data, docs and pitch among themselves.
  *Prompt:* "Only I want to approve app changes."

## Milestone: Working rules and change log – 2026-10-25
- **2026-10-25 – Completed CLAUDE.md:** added Git, pull request and change
  documentation rules (previously only the merge section was present).
  *Why:* so every vibe-coding change is committed, described and traceable.
  *Prompt:* "Create a complete CLAUDE.md adapted to the Claude Code
  branch/pull-request workflow."
- **2026-10-25 – Added CHANGELOG.md:** this file.
  *Why:* documents the vibe-coding process for the final report.
